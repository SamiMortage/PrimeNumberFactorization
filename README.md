# PrimeNumberFactorization
Project Overview:  

A program that determines whether a number N can be factored into exactly two primes, and if it can be factored, identifies the values of the two factors. It will be implemented using unix pipes, processes, and the The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for indetifying prime numbers.
